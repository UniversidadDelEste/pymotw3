msgid "A *socket* is one endpoint of a communication channel used by programs to pass data back and forth locally or across the Internet.  Sockets have two primary properties controlling the way they send data: the *address family* controls the OSI network layer protocol used and the *socket type* controls the transport layer protocol."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:11
msgid "Python supports three address families.  The most common, ``AF_INET``, is used for IPv4 Internet addressing.  IPv4 addresses are four bytes long and are usually represented as a sequence of four numbers, one per octet, separated by dots (e.g., ``10.1.1.5`` and ``127.0.0.1``).  These values are more commonly referred to as \"IP addresses.\"  Almost all Internet networking is done using IP version 4 at this time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:19
msgid "``AF_INET6`` is used for IPv6 Internet addressing.  IPv6 is the \"next generation\" version of the Internet protocol, and supports 128-bit addresses, traffic shaping, and routing features not available under IPv4.  Adoption of IPv6 continues to grow, especially with the proliferation of cloud computing and the extra devices being added to the network because of Internet-of-things projects."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:26
msgid "``AF_UNIX`` is the address family for Unix Domain Sockets (UDS), an inter-process communication protocol available on POSIX-compliant systems.  The implementation of UDS typically allows the operating system to pass data directly from process to process, without going through the network stack.  This is more efficient than using ``AF_INET``, but because the file system is used as the namespace for addressing, UDS is restricted to processes on the same system. The appeal of using UDS over other IPC mechanisms such as named pipes or shared memory is that the programming interface is the same as for IP networking, so the application can take advantage of efficient communication when running on a single host, but use the same code when sending data across the network."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:41
msgid "The ``AF_UNIX`` constant is only defined on systems where UDS is supported."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:44
msgid "The socket type is usually either ``SOCK_DGRAM`` for message-oriented datagram transport or ``SOCK_STREAM`` for stream-oriented transport. Datagram sockets are most often associated with UDP, the *user datagram protocol*. They provide unreliable delivery of individual messages. Stream-oriented sockets are associated with TCP, *transmission control protocol*. They provide byte streams between the client and server, ensuring message delivery or failure notification through timeout management, retransmission, and other features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/socket/addressing.rst:53
msgid "Most application protocols that deliver a large amount of data, such as HTTP, are built on top of TCP because it makes it simpler to create complex applications when message ordering and delivery is handled automatically. UDP is commonly used for protocols where order is less important (since the messages are self-contained and often small, such as name look-ups via DNS), or for *multicasting* (sending the same data to several hosts). Both UDP and TCP can be used with either IPv4 or IPv6 addressing."

Applications do not need to convert addresses explicitly before using them to connect to a server, but it can be useful when reporting errors to include the numerical address as well as the name value being used."
