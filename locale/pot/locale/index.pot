msgid "The ``locale`` module is part of Python's internationalization and localization support library. It provides a standard way to handle operations that may depend on the language or location of a user. For example, it handles formatting numbers as currency, comparing strings for sorting, and working with dates. It does not cover translation (see the :mod:`gettext` module) or Unicode encoding (see the :mod:`codecs` module)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/locale/index.rst:20
msgid "Changing the locale can have application-wide ramifications, so the recommended practice is to avoid changing the value in a library and to let the application set it one time. In the examples in this section, the locale is changed several times within a short program to highlight the differences in the settings of various locales. It is far more likely that an application will set the locale once as it starts up or when a web request is received and not change it."

#: ../../source/locale/index.rst:28
msgid "This section covers some of the high-level functions in the ``locale`` module. There are others which are lower level (``format_string()``) or which relate to managing the locale for an application (``resetlocale()``)."

#: ../../source/locale/index.rst:36
msgid "The most common way to let the user change the locale settings for an application is through an environment variable (``LC_ALL``, ``LC_CTYPE``, ``LANG``, or ``LANGUAGE``, depending on the platform). The application then calls ``setlocale()`` without a hard-coded value, and the environment value is used."
