msgid "The low-level :mod:`socket` library provides direct access to the native C socket library, and can be used to communicate with any network service.  :mod:`selectors` provides a high-level interface for watching multiple sockets simultaneously, and is useful for allowing network servers to communicate with multiple clients simultaneously. :mod:`select` provides the low-level APIs used by :mod:`selectors`."

msgid "The frameworks in :mod:`socketserver` abstract out a lot of the repetitive work necessary to create a new network server.  The classes can be combined to create servers that fork or use threads and support TCP or UDP.  Only the actual message handling needs to be provided by the application."
