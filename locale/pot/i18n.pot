msgid "Python comes with two modules for preparing an application to work with multiple natural languages and cultural settings.  :mod:`gettext` is used to create message catalogs in different languages, so that prompts and error messages can be displayed in a language the user can understand.  :mod:`locale` changes the way numbers, currency, dates, and times are formatted to take into account cultural differences such as how negative values are indicated and what the local currency symbol is.  Both modules interface with other tools and the operating environment to make the Python application fit in with all of the other programs on the system."
