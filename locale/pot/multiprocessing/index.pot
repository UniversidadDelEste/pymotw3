msgid "The ``multiprocessing`` module includes an API for dividing work up between multiple processes based on the API for :mod:`threading`.  In some cases ``multiprocessing`` is a drop-in replacement, and can be used instead of ``threading`` to take advantage of multiple CPU cores to avoid computational bottlenecks associated with Python's global interpreter lock."

msgid "Due to the similarity, the first few examples here are modified from the ``threading`` examples.  Features provided by ``multiprocessing`` but not available in ``threading`` are covered later."
