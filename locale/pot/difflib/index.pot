msgid "Compare sequences, especially lines of text."

msgid "The ``difflib`` module contains tools for computing and working with differences between sequences.  It is especially useful for comparing text, and includes functions that produce reports using several common difference formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:15
msgid "The examples in this section will all use this common test data in the ``difflib_data.py`` module:"

msgid "Comparing Bodies of Text"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:25
msgid "The ``Differ`` class works on sequences of text lines and produces human-readable *deltas*, or change instructions, including differences within individual lines.  The default output produced by ``Differ`` is similar to the ``diff`` command-line tool under Unix.  It includes the original input values from both lists, including common values, and markup data to indicate which changes were made."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:33
msgid "Lines prefixed with ``-`` were in the first sequence, but not the second."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:35
msgid "Lines prefixed with ``+`` were in the second sequence, but not the first."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:37
msgid "If a line has an incremental difference between versions, an extra line prefixed with ``?`` is used to highlight the change within the new version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:40
msgid "If a line has not changed, it is printed with an extra blank space on the left column so that it is aligned with the other output that may have differences."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:44
msgid "Breaking the text up into a sequence of individual lines before passing it to ``compare()`` produces more readable output than passing in large strings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:0
msgid "difflib_differ.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:58
msgid "The beginning of both text segments in the sample data is the same, so the first line is printed without any extra annotation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:64
msgid "The third line of the data has been changed to include a comma in the modified text. Both versions of the line are printed, with the extra information on line 5 showing the column where the text was modified, including the fact that the ``,`` character was added."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:73
msgid "The next few lines of the output show that an extra space was removed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:79
msgid "Next, a more complex change was made, replacing several words in a phrase."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:85
msgid "The last sentence in the paragraph was changed significantly, so the difference is represented by removing the old version and adding the new."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:93
msgid "The ``ndiff()`` function produces essentially the same output. The processing is specifically tailored for working with text data and eliminating \"noise\" in the input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:98
msgid "Other Output Formats"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:100
msgid "While the ``Differ`` class shows all of the input lines, a *unified diff* includes only the modified lines and a bit of context. The ``unified_diff()`` function produces this sort of output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:0
msgid "difflib_unified.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:108
msgid "The ``lineterm`` argument is used to tell ``unified_diff()`` to skip appending newlines to the control lines that it returns because the input lines do not include them.  Newlines are added to all of the lines when they are printed.  The output should look familiar to users of many popular version-control tools."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:145
msgid "Using ``context_diff()`` produces similar readable output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:148
msgid "Junk Data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:150
msgid "All of the functions that produce difference sequences accept arguments to indicate which lines should be ignored and which characters within a line should be ignored. These parameters can be used to skip over markup or whitespace changes in two versions of a file, for example."
msgstr ""

msgid "difflib_junk.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:160
msgid "The default for ``Differ`` is to not ignore any lines or characters explicitly, but rather to rely on the ability of ``SequenceMatcher`` to detect noise. The default for ``ndiff()`` is to ignore space and tab characters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:194
msgid "Comparing Arbitrary Types"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:196
msgid "The ``SequenceMatcher`` class compares two sequences of any types, as long as the values are hashable. It uses an algorithm to identify the longest contiguous matching blocks from the sequences, eliminating \"junk\" values that do not contribute to the real data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/difflib/index.rst:201
msgid "The funct ``get_opcodes()`` returns a list of instructions for modifying the first sequence to make it match the second. The instructions are encoded as five-element tuples, including a string instruction (the \"opcode\", see :table:`difflib.get_opcodes() Instructions`) and two pairs of start and stop indexes into the sequences (denoted as ``i1``, ``i2``, ``j1``, and ``j2``)."
