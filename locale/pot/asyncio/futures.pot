msgid "Producing Results Asynchronously"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:5
msgid "A ``Future`` represents the result of work that has not been completed yet. The event loop can watch for a ``Future`` object's state to indicate that it is done, allowing one part of an application to wait for another part to finish some work."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:11
msgid "Waiting for a Future"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:13
msgid "A ``Future`` acts like a coroutine, so any techniques useful for waiting for a coroutine can also be used to wait for the future to be marked done. This example passes the future to the event loop's ``run_until_complete()`` method."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:0
msgid "asyncio_future_event_loop.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:22
msgid "The state of the ``Future`` changes to done when ``set_result()`` is called, and the ``Future`` instance retains the result given to the method for retrieval later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:43
msgid "A ``Future`` can also be used with the ``await`` keyword, as in this example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:0
msgid "asyncio_future_await.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:50
msgid "The result of the ``Future`` is returned by ``await``, so it is frequently possible to have the same code work with a regular coroutine and a ``Future`` instance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:69
msgid "Future Callbacks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:71
msgid "In addition to working like a coroutine, a ``Future`` can invoke callbacks when it is completed. Callbacks are invoked in the order they are registered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:0
msgid "asyncio_future_callback.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/futures.rst:79
msgid "The callback should expect one argument, the ``Future`` instance. To pass additional arguments to the callbacks, use ``functools.partial()`` to create a wrapper."
