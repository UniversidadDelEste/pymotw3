#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:5
msgid "Coroutines are a language construct designed for concurrent operation. A coroutine function creates a coroutine object when called, and the caller can then run the code of the function using the coroutine's ``send()`` method. A coroutine can pause execution using the ``await`` keyword with another coroutine. While it is paused, the coroutine's state is maintained, allowing it to resume where it left off the next time it is awakened."

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:16
msgid "There are a few different ways to have the ``asyncio`` event loop start a coroutine. The simplest is to use ``run_until_complete()``, passing the coroutine to it directly."

msgid "asyncio_coroutine.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:24
msgid "The first step is to obtain a reference to the event loop. The default loop type can be used, or a specific loop class can be instantiated. In this example, the default loop is used. The ``run_until_complete()`` method starts the loop with the coroutine object and stops the loop when the coroutine exits by returning."

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:48
msgid "The return value of a coroutine is passed back to the code that starts and waits for it."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:55
msgid "In this case, ``run_until_complete()`` also returns the result of the coroutine it is waiting for."

msgid "Chaining Coroutines"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:75
msgid "One coroutine can start another coroutine and wait for the results. This makes it easier to decompose a task into reusable parts. The following example has two phases that must be executed in order, but that can run concurrently with other operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:0
msgid "asyncio_coroutine_chain.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:84
msgid "The ``await`` keyword is used instead of adding the new coroutines to the loop, because control flow is already inside of a coroutine being managed by the loop so it isn't necessary to tell the loop to manage the new coroutines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:107
msgid "Generators Instead of Coroutines"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:109
msgid "Coroutine functions are a key component of the design of ``asyncio``. They provide a language construct for stopping the execution of part of a program, preserving the state of that call, and re-entering the state at a later time, which are all important capabilities for a concurrency framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:115
msgid "Python 3.5 introduced new language features to define such coroutines natively using ``async def`` and to yield control using ``await``, and the examples for ``asyncio`` take advantage of the new feature. Earlier versions of Python 3 can use generator functions wrapped with the ``asyncio.coroutine()`` decorator and ``yield from`` to achieve the same effect."

#: ../../source/asyncio/coroutines.rst:126
msgid "The preceding example reproduces ``asyncio_coroutine_chain.py`` using generator functions instead of native coroutines."
