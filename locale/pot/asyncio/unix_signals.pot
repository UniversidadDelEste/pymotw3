msgid "Unix system event notifications normally interrupt an application, triggering their handler. When used with ``asyncio``, signal handler callbacks are interleaved with the other coroutines and callbacks managed by the event loop. This results in fewer interrupted functions, and the resulting need to provide safe-guards for cleaning up incomplete operations."

#: ../../source/asyncio/unix_signals.rst:18
msgid "The signal handlers are registered using ``add_signal_handler()``. The first argument is the signal and the second is the callback.  Callbacks are passed no arguments, so if arguments are needed a function can be wrapped with ``functools.partial()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/unix_signals.rst:27
msgid "This example program uses a coroutine to send signals to itself via ``os.kill()``. After each signal is sent, the coroutine yields control to allow the handler to be run. In a normal application, there would be more places where application code yields back to the event loop and no artificial yield like this would be needed."
