#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:5
msgid "It is frequently necessary to work with other programs and processes, to take advantage of existing code without rewriting it or to access libraries or features not available from within Python. As with network I/O, ``asyncio`` includes two abstractions for starting another program and then interacting with it."

msgid "Using the Protocol Abstraction with Subprocesses"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:14
msgid "This example uses a coroutine to launch a process to run the Unix command ``df`` to find the free space on local disks. It uses ``subprocess_exec()`` to launch the process and tie it to a protocol class that knows how to read the ``df`` command output and parse it. The methods of the protocol class are called automatically based on I/O events for the subprocess. Because both the ``stdin`` and ``stderr`` arguments are set to ``None``, those communication channels are not connected to the new process."

msgid "asyncio_subprocess_protocol.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:27
msgid "The class ``DFProtocol`` is derived from ``SubprocessProtocol``, which defines the API for a class to communicate with another process through pipes. The ``done`` argument is expected to be a ``Future`` that the caller will use to watch for the process to finish."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:36
msgid "As with socket communication, ``connection_made()`` is invoked when the input channels to the new process are set up. The ``transport`` argument is an instance of a subclass of ``BaseSubprocessTransport``. It can read data output by the process and write data to the input stream for the process, if the process was configured to receive input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:46
msgid "When the process has generated output, ``pipe_data_received()`` is invoked with the file descriptor where the data was emitted and the actual data read from the pipe. The protocol class saves the output from the standard output channel of the process in a buffer for later processing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:55
msgid "When the process terminates, ``process_exited()`` is called. The exit code of the process is available from the transport object by calling ``get_returncode()``. In this case, if there is no error reported the available output is decoded and parsed before being returned through the ``Future`` instance. If there is an error, the results are assumed to be empty. Setting the result of the future tells ``run_df()`` that the process has exited, so it cleans up and then returns the results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:67
msgid "The command output is parsed into a sequence of dictionaries mapping the header names to their values for each line of output, and the resulting list is returned."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:74
msgid "The ``run_df()`` coroutine is run using ``run_until_complete()``, then the results are examined and the free space on each device is printed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:81
msgid "The output below shows the sequence of steps taken, and the free space on three drives on the system where it was run."

msgid "Calling Subprocesses with Coroutines and Streams"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:111
msgid "To use coroutines to run a process directly, instead of accessing it through a ``Protocol`` subclass, call ``create_subprocess_exec()`` and specify which of ``stdout``, ``stderr``, and ``stdin`` to connect to a pipe. The result of the coroutine to spawn the subprocess is a ``Process`` instance that can be used to manipulate the subprocess or communicate with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "asyncio_subprocess_coroutine.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:122
msgid "In this example, ``df`` does not need any input other than its command line arguments, so the next step is to read all of the output. With the ``Protocol`` there is no control over how much data is read at a time. This example uses ``readline()`` but it could also call ``read()`` directly to read data that is not line-oriented. The output of the command is buffered, as with the protocol example, so it can be parsed later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:133
msgid "The ``readline()`` method returns an empty byte string when there is no more output because the program has finished. To ensure the process is cleaned up properly, the next step is to wait for the process to exit fully."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:141
msgid "At that point the exit status can be examined to determine whether to parse the output or treat the error as it produced no output. The parsing logic is the same as in the previous example, but is in a stand-alone function (not shown here) because there is no protocol class to hide it in. After the data is parsed, the results and exit code are then returned to the caller."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:151
msgid "The main program looks similar to the protocol-based example, because the implementation changes are isolated in ``run_df()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:157
msgid "Since the output from ``df`` can be read one line at a time, it is echoed to show the progress of the program. Otherwise, the output looks similar to the previous example."

msgid "Sending Data to a Subprocess"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:196
msgid "Both of the previous examples used only a single communication channel to read data from a second process. It is often necessary to send data into a command for processing. This example defines a coroutine to execute the Unix command ``tr`` for translating characters in its input stream. In this case, ``tr`` is used to convert lower-case letters to upper-case letters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:203
msgid "The ``to_upper()`` coroutine takes as argument an event loop and an input string. It spawns a second process running ``\"tr [:lower:] [:upper:]\"``."

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:0
msgid "asyncio_subprocess_coroutine_write.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:211
msgid "Next ``to_upper()`` uses the ``communicate()`` method of the ``Process`` to send the input string to the command and read all of the resulting output, asynchronously. As with the ``subprocess.Popen`` version of the same method, ``communicate()`` returns the complete output byte strings. If a command is likely to produce more data than can fit comfortably into memory, the input cannot be produced all at once, or the output must be processed incrementally, it is possible to use the stdin, stdout, and stderr handles of the ``Process`` directly instead of calling ``communicate()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:225
msgid "After the I/O is done, waiting for the process to completely exit ensures it is cleaned up properly."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:231
msgid "The return code can then be examined, and the output byte string decoded, to prepare the return value from the coroutine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/asyncio/subprocesses.rst:237
msgid "The main part of the program establishes a message string to be transformed, and then sets up the event loop to run ``to_upper()`` and prints the results."
