msgid "In addition to its parsing capabilities, ``xml.etree.ElementTree`` also supports creating well-formed XML documents from ``Element`` objects constructed in an application.  The ``Element`` class used when a document is parsed also knows how to generate a serialized form of its contents, which can then be written to a file or other data stream."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xml.etree.ElementTree/create.rst:13
msgid "There are three helper functions useful for creating a hierarchy of ``Element`` nodes.  ``Element()`` creates a standard node, ``SubElement()`` attaches a new node to a parent, and ``Comment()`` creates a node that serializes using XML's comment syntax."

msgid "Pretty-Printing XML"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xml.etree.ElementTree/create.rst:47
msgid "``ElementTree`` makes no effort to format the output of ``tostring()`` to make it easy to read because adding extra whitespace changes the contents of the document.  To make the output easier to follow, the rest of the examples will use :mod:`xml.dom.minidom` to re-parse the XML then use its ``toprettyxml()`` method."

msgid "Setting Element Properties"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xml.etree.ElementTree/create.rst:93
msgid "The previous example created nodes with tags and text content, but did not set any attributes of the nodes.  Many of the examples from :ref:`xml.etree.ElementTree.parsing` worked with an OPML file listing podcasts and their feeds.  The ``outline`` nodes in the tree used attributes for the group names and podcast properties. ``ElementTree`` can be used to construct a similar XML file from a CSV input file, setting all of the element attributes as the tree is constructed."

#: ../../source/xml.etree.ElementTree/create.rst:211
msgid "It is important to understand that ``extend()`` does not modify any existing parent-child relationships with the nodes.  If the values passed to ``extend()`` exist somewhere in the tree already, they will still be there, and will be repeated in the output."

#: ../../source/xml.etree.ElementTree/create.rst:267
msgid "``tostring()`` is implemented by writing to an in-memory file-like object, then returning a string representing the entire element tree. When working with large amounts of data, it will take less memory and make more efficient use of the I/O libraries to write directly to a file handle using the ``write()`` method of ``ElementTree``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/xml.etree.ElementTree/create.rst:297
msgid "The last node in the tree contains no text or sub-nodes, so it is written as an empty tag, ``<empty_child />``.  ``write()`` takes a ``method`` argument to control the handling for empty nodes."
