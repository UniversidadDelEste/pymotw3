msgid "The ``string`` module dates from the earliest versions of Python. Many of the functions previously implemented in this module have been moved to methods of ``str`` objects. The ``string`` module retains several useful constants and classes for working with ``str`` objects. This discussion will concentrate on them."

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:19
msgid "The function ``capwords()`` capitalizes all of the words in a string."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:0
msgid "string_capwords.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:26
msgid "The results are the same as those obtained by calling ``split()``, capitalizing the words in the resulting list, and then calling ``join()`` to combine the results."
msgstr ""

msgid "Templates"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:46
msgid "String templates were added as part of :pep:`292` and are intended as an alternative to the built-in interpolation syntax. With ``string.Template`` interpolation, variables are identified by prefixing the name with ``$`` (e.g., ``$var``). Alternatively, if necessary to set them off from surrounding text, they can also be wrapped with curly braces (e.g., ``${var}``)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:53
msgid "This example compares a simple template with similar string interpolation using the ``%`` operator and the new format string syntax using ``str.format()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:0
msgid "string_template.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:61
msgid "In the first two cases, the trigger character (``$`` or ``%``) is escaped by repeating it twice. For the format syntax, both ``{`` and ``}`` need to be escaped by repeating them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:91
msgid "One key difference between templates and string interpolation or formatting is that the type of the arguments is not taken into account. The values are converted to strings, and the strings are inserted into the result. No formatting options are available. For example, there is no way to control the number of digits used to represent a floating-point value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:98
msgid "A benefit, though, is that use of the ``safe_substitute()`` method makes it possible to avoid exceptions if not all of the values needed by the template are provided as arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:0
msgid "string_template_missing.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:106
msgid "Since there is no value for ``missing`` in the values dictionary, a ``KeyError`` is raised by ``substitute()``. Instead of raising the error, ``safe_substitute()`` catches it and leaves the variable expression alone in the text."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:125
msgid "Advanced Templates"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:127
msgid "The default syntax for ``string.Template`` can be changed by adjusting the regular expression patterns it uses to find the variable names in the template body. A simple way to do that is to change the :attr:`delimiter` and :attr:`idpattern` class attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:0
msgid "string_template_advanced.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:136
msgid "In this example, the substitution rules are changed so that the delimiter is ``%`` instead of ``$`` and variable names must include an underscore somewhere in the middle.  The pattern ``%notunderscored`` is not replaced by anything, because it does not include an underscore character."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:159
msgid "For even more complex changes, it is possible to override the :attr:`pattern` attribute and define an entirely new regular expression. The pattern provided must contain four named groups for capturing the escaped delimiter, the named variable, a braced version of the variable name, and invalid delimiter patterns."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:0
msgid "string_template_defaultpattern.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:169
msgid "The value of ``t.pattern`` is a compiled regular expression, but the original string is available via its :attr:`pattern` attribute."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:183
msgid "This example defines a new pattern to create a new type of template, using ``{{var}}`` as the variable syntax."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:190
msgid "Both the :attr:`named` and :attr:`braced` patterns must be provided separately, even though they are the same.  Running the sample program generates the following output:"

msgid "Formatter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:213
msgid "The ``Formatter`` class implements the same layout specification language as the ``format()`` method of ``str``. Its features include type coersion, alignment, attribute and field references, named and positional template arguments, and type-specific formatting options. Most of the time the ``format()`` method is a more convenient interface to these features, but ``Formatter`` is provided as a way to build subclasses, for cases where variations are needed."

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:225
msgid "The ``string`` module includes a number of constants related to ASCII and numerical character sets."

msgid "string_constants.py"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/string/index.rst:232
msgid "These constants are useful when working with ASCII data, but since it is increasingly common to encounter non-ASCII text in some form of Unicode, their application is limited."
