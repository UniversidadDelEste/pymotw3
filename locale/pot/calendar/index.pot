#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:11
msgid "The ``calendar`` module defines the ``Calendar`` class, which encapsulates calculations for values such as the dates of the weeks in a given month or year. In addition, the ``TextCalendar`` and ``HTMLCalendar`` classes can produce pre-formatted output."

msgid "The output looks like:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:52
msgid "A similar HTML table can be produced with ``HTMLCalendar`` and ``formatmonth()``.  The rendered output looks roughly the same as the plain text version, but is wrapped with HTML tags.  Each table cell has a class attribute corresponding to the day of the week, so the HTML can be styled through CSS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:58
msgid "To produce output in a format other than one of the available defaults, use ``calendar`` to calculate the dates and organize the values into week and month ranges, then iterate over the result.  The ``weekheader()``, ``monthcalendar()``, and ``yeardays2calendar()`` methods of ``Calendar`` are especially useful for that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:65
msgid "Calling ``yeardays2calendar()`` produces a sequence of \"month row\" lists. Each list includes the months as another list of weeks. The weeks are lists of tuples made up of day number (1-31) and weekday number (0-6). Days that fall outside of the month have a day number of 0."

msgid "Although the calendar module focuses mostly on printing full calendars in various formats, it also provides functions useful for working with dates in other ways, such as calculating dates for a recurring event. For example, the Python Atlanta User's Group meets on the second Thursday of every month. To calculate the dates for the meetings for a year, use the return value of ``monthcalendar()``."

#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:242
msgid "The first day of the week defaults to Monday. It is possible to change that by calling ``setfirstweekday()``, but since the calendar module includes constants for indexing into the date ranges returned by ``monthcalendar()``, it is more convenient to skip that step in this case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/calendar/index.rst:248
msgid "To calculate the group meeting dates for a year, assuming they are always on the second Thursday of every month, look at the output of ``monthcalendar()`` to find the dates on which Thursdays fall. The first and last week of the month are padded with 0 values as placeholders for the days falling in the preceding or subsequent month. For example, if a month starts on a Friday, the value in the first week in the Thursday position will be 0."
