msgid "While Python is the \"Batteries Included\" programming language and comes with a wide variety of modules in the standard library, there are even more libraries, frameworks, and tools available to be installed from the `Python Package Index`_. To install those packages, a developer needs the installer tool ``pip``. Installing a tool meant to install tools presents an interesting bootstrapping issue, which ``ensurepip`` solves."

This version can then be used to install an updated version of pip.  To ensure a recent version of ``pip`` is installed immediately, use the ``--upgrade`` option with ``ensurepip``."
